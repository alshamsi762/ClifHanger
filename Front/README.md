## Server Stager:
A small python HTTP server is running on the CS Data. It should be used for testing your code. The person running the server needs to *git pull* to make changes appear on the browser. ThreeJS, Orbital Controls, Detector & STL Loader are already reference in the HTML and don't need to be added separately.

*Terminal Usage:*
```bash
python server.py [port]
```

*Browser Usage:*
```
data.cs.purdue.edu:[port]
```
