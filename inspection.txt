1.  In startTurnFor(player), set player.status = 1 instead of this.currPlayer.status = 1 since setting
    this.currPlayer.status = 1 wasn't clear if it was changing the actual player's status.

2.  useItem(item, direction) can accept either a string or a boardspace for direction.
    This could lead to confusing behavior if not documented and used correctly.
