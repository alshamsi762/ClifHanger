1.  In startTurnFor(player), set player.status = 1 instead of this.currPlayer.status = 1 since setting
    this.currPlayer.status = 1 wasn't clear if it was changing the actual player's status.

2.  useItem(item, direction) can accept either a string or a boardspace for direction.
    This could lead to confusing behavior if not documented and used correctly.

3. Using number literals for conditionals concerning objects of another class could be confusing.
   Added constants to each class which can be used elsewhere instead of putting a number value.
